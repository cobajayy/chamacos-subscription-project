<h1>Welcome to Chamaco's Coffee Subscription! </h1>

<h3>Fresh roasted coffee delivered to your door! </h3>
<br></br>
<p>Goal: My goal was to create a subscription based website that allows users to customize their coffee beans based on their perferences (ie. brewing method, whole beans or ground, origin, and more). As a user you will be able to sign up, sign in, add subsciptions, edit your subscriptions, delete your subscriptions, view other users subscriptions (read me only), and sign out. </p>

Deployed Link: Coming Monday
<br></br>
<p>Technologies: My main technology used was JavaScript, MongoDB, Node.js, CSS, and HTML.  I used packages within these technologies such as:
<ul>
<li>
bcrypt, dotenv, ejs, express, express-session, method-override, morgan, mongoose.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Next steps: 
    <ul>
        <li>Styling-details: I want to create a more aesthetic dropdown bar when adding new or editing subscriptions. When selecting the community page, I do not want the user signed in to be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>Update the show page to render an image based off the preferred brewing method (ie. for espresso show an image of an espresso machine).
        </li>
        <li>Adding a shopping cart and a way to process transactions.
        </li>
    </ul></p>
